# Chronos

Discord bot to automatically tweak slowmode to match the user activity in the channels.

## Getting started
It's very simple to get this bot up and running for development!

If you wish to contribute you should first fork the repo and clone that rather than the upstream.

If you're a little stuck about contributing may I suggest a great resource by [woojiahao](https://github.com/woojiahao) which can be viewed [here](https://woojiahao.github.io/git-guide/04-collaboration/)
